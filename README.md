# Store Item Tracker API

This API is for keeping track of stores and their item inventories. Items are searchable across all stores via category tags. Registred users may search, add, delete, or update stores, items, and their tags. Non-registered users may search existing stores, items, or tags. 

# Documentation

See [Docs here](https://store-item-tracker-api.onrender.com/swagger-ui) for a listing of all endpoints and details on how to send requests and the responses they will return. 
You may also use these [Docs](https://store-item-tracker-api.onrender.com/swagger-ui) to manually send test requests to the API on any endpoint.
